# a summary about you
summary: "Hi, I'm Michael, a naturally curious and self-taught tech guy currently working as a DevOps Engineer. My day-to-day involves automating infrastructure (think Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD) and ensuring systems run smoothly. With a background touching various corners of IT over the last 10 years, I bring a practical, hands-on approach. Outside of work, this translates into a serious self-hosting habit and a commitment to privacy. Essentially, I love building cool things and understanding how they tick."
