  - name: My Accidental Private Cloud - Building Cloud-Native Infrastructure at Home

    summary: So, I accidentally built my own private cloud. Tired of subscriptions and attacks on my privacy, I started self-hosting a simple media server using only hardware I had laying around. One thing led to another and now I have a hypervisor, k8s cluster, and GitOps pipelines humming away on ancient gear cobbled together with shoestrings and a disdain for spending even a penny. Now it runs my entire digital life.

    summary: In an effort to maintain some semblance of privacy, I built my own inference server out of several nvidia GPUs, then I customized OpenWebUI with my own RAG pipeline in order to better utilize the plethora of notes I've accumulated over time.
